## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

During this project I reinforced and learned some important concepts.
- such as importing Google Fonts.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
- Use of flex display.
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and achieve bigger projects with more clarity.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For a better understanding of the flex display
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -  A great resource for finding and implementing web fonts.
